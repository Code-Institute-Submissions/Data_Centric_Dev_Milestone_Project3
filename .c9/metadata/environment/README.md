The aim of the site is to provide fertile ground for the book loving community to come together to read, rate and review literature. Users join up to engage with others and express their love (or hate!) for books they’ve read and to discover new literature. ","Bukish allows users to store their personalised content, to delete and update reviews and comments they’ve made to allow for a personalized experience. ","It was essential also to create a scalable application, capable efficiently of handling growing numbers of users and their input. ","Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.","## UX","As specified in the project requirements, the purpose of this project is to “build a full-stack site that allows your users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain”.","","The goal of this milestone project was to create a web application using Python, the Flask libraries (a Python framework), a NoSQL Document-Based Database (in my case; Mongo DB) to construct the functioning app as well as incorporate the main tenants of CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete). ","","My aim was to create a simple, efficient and sleek user friendly site, using intuitive design and enticing colours to guide user. ","","So with these focal points in mind, I tried to adjust the UX of this site for the following user type:",""," ","### User Stories","","Typical, archetypal user would be interested in reading and writing reviews. They would also be willing members of an online community.","•\tAs a user, I would like to sign up so I can access reviews and comments. ","•\tAs a user, I would like to add my own personalized reviews and comments. ","•\tAs a user, I would like to add participate in an online community for a topic that I’m interested in. ","•\tAs a user, I would like to express and share my own views within a likeminded community. ","•\tAs a user, I would like to update and/or delete my reviews or my comments at any time and also not have any other user update and/or delete my content.","","Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.","In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:","•\tAs a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.","This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.","Features","In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.","Existing Features","•\tFeature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z","•\t...","For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.","In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:","Features Left to Implement","•\tHTML","•\tCSS3","•\tJavascript","•\tBootstrap","•\tPython","•\tFlask","•\tMongoDB","Technologies Used","In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.","•\tJQuery","o\tThe project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.","Testing","In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.","Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.","For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:","1.\tContact form:","i.\tGo to the \"Contact Us\" page","ii.\tTry to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears","iii.\tTry to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears","iv.\tTry to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.","In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.","You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.","If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.","Deployment","This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).","In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:","•\tDifferent values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?","•\tDifferent configuration files?","•\tSeparate git branch?","In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.","Credits","Content","•\tThe
